# About me

Hi! My name is Elias Nafziger, I'm a junior at the College of William and Mary pursing a major in Biology with a minor in Data Science. Since 2018 I've been a member of Dr. Margaret Saha's lab where I've worked in phage genemoics and engineered living materials (ELMs) through the iGEM team. Aside from academics I'm a a content team member in WMCovidCulture, play sting bass in an Appalachian string group, and am a member of Salsa Club. When I'm home, catch me hiking around the Shenandoah Valley or reading a book with my cats.

Welcome to my GitHub, and thanks for stoping by. Hopefully it'll become more interesting as the semester goes on.
