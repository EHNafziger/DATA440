## Using widely available spatial data to predict groundwater nitrate concentration

  Nitrates are essential nutrients for most plants, particularly for domesticated crops since soil depletion is a common issue. Nitrates can be added to the soil as fertilizer to help counter soil depletion and increase crop yield. However, these nutrients can runoff or leak from groundwater aquifers into waterways and damage them by causing eutrophic conditions. In high enough concentrations, consuming nitrate-contaminated water can also harm human health. Water testing is one way to detect these chemicals, but point-source data is not always available in all localities. One work around is to use machine learning and statistical modeling to predict areas of high groundwater nitrate concentration using large-scale spatially available data. Researchers Knoll, Breuer, and Bach used a GIS-based statistical approach to make such predictions in a 1 km2 grid of Hesse, Germany.

  Based on past works, Knoll, Breuer, and Bach used 14 spatial predictor variables (urban land, arable land, grassland, forest, special crops, N-surplus on agricultural land, hydrogeological units, seepage rate, recharge rate, nitrate concentration in seepage, nitrate concentration in groundwater recharge, soil group, field capacity, and humus content) to model circular buffer zones and the direction of groundwater flow. Each buffer assumes homogeny and a general flow direction, which is then fitted into the rest of the grid. Four model types (multiple linear regression, random forest, classification and regression tree, and boosted regression trees) were trained with a stratified randomly sampled data set and their final predictions compared based on mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R2. Of the models, the random forest performed the best (R2 = 0.54, MAE = 5.90, RMSE = 9.19), probably since this model reduces overall variance by averaging sets of randomly generated trees. This model’s most important predictors were listed as hydrogeological units, percent arable land, and N-surplus on agricultural land. However, all models were mostly similar on a large scale and all indicated higher concentration of nitrates in agricultural areas. The authors noted the transferability of this method to other regions where point measurements are not available.

  This was one of the first data science papers I have read, so while the techniques may not be that new to the field, they were very new to me. I realized I am out of my depth when it comes to the statistical predictions and terms described but endeavored to understand nevertheless. The figures were very helpful in this respect, particularly the workflow of machine learning. I was particularly interested in the regression models listed and how they are designed. Knoll and Bach’s work was done in R and the “caret” package, but I could not find a script in either the paper or the supplementary materials. I’m not sure if publishing the script is common practice in the field or not. With my background in synthetic biology, we use machine learning models often enough that I should be able to at least identify which ones are most appropriate for what application, and I hope that this course will help me along that path. In terms of the practical use of this modeling technique, I can see how it could really be turned to any spatial-prediction project by swapping in the most relevant predictor variables and running testing them in regression models. With the current pandemic in mind, I would be interested to try this approach and see if it is possible to create a reasonable model for predicting what areas will be hardest hit by a novel pathogen outbreak.
