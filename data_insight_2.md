 ## The role of data warehousing in bioterrorism surveillance 
 
 If the current COVID-19 pandemic has shown us anything, it is that disease outbreaks are still a threat despite our medical and scientific advances. In cases of targeted and intentional introduction of a pathogen into a population, most legalities are woefully unprepared. Bioterrorism, while thankfully uncommon, has the potential to cause extreme and far-reaching damage to not only human life, but societal and economic stability. The most recent attack in the United States was in 2001 during which anthrax was sent through mail, killing 5. Rapid detection and response to such bioterror or chemical attacks is key to controlling spread, minimizing impact, and saving lives. With this issue in mind, researchers Berndt et al. at the University of South Florida designed a system to help epidemiologists identify possible attacks.
	In their paper “The role of data warehousing in bioterrorism surveillance,” the researchers incorporate four aspects into their surveillance system: multidimensional data sets, real-time (flash) data, pattern recognition software, and a data-analysis environment. Multidimensional data allows many important factors to be considered at once, such as specific case counts, emergency room (ER) admissions, and water and air metrics. Much of the clinical data can be collected from hospitals and clinics, and though environmental data is not as constantly updated, historical data can be used to build the bedrock of a data warehouse. Flash data is a stream of constantly overwritten data which can be compared and shared with the data warehouse and pattern algorithms. This is a key component of rapid response since flash data is the most up to date and accurate for a situation that can change quickly. Pattern recognition software helps highlight potential alerts by comparing the warehouse and flash data sets. The authors use the example of setting warning thresholds for a singular hospital or for hospitals within a certain area of each other as a potential screening method. With the advent of machine learning, it would certainly be possible to create models of bioterror attacks and use the output as a training set for enhanced threat identification. Finally, data analysis in the form of online analytic processing (OLAP) is employed to allow epidemiologist to look at the different levels of detail in a possible alert. The OLAP environment combined with geographical information systems (GIS) allows visualization of multiple layers of variables and for their subsequent statistical analysis. To test the system, researchers used several years of data containing the fallout of wildfires to simulate point source biological attacks (over 100,000 fires over 20 years). The wildfires created conditions health officials advised should be avoided for those with respiratory issues. By taking the zip codes effected by the wildfires’ health advisory, the team was able to analyze the change in asthma rate in the context of socioeconomics, age, and ethnicity. In the age subgroup there was a significant difference in asthma rates during wildfires, suggesting that while traditional statistical analysis methods can be of use, there is room for improvement. The system may have performed better with simulated data or if it had utilized some form of machine learning to identify potential alerts.
	Though this experiment was not completely successful, it lays the groundwork for addressing a potentially severe problem. Weaponization of microorganisms is considered a security risk by governments and certainly bioengineers. A simple bachelor’s or Master’s degree contains enough information to at least attempt a biological attack. However, Big Data and machine learning could be highly effective in preventing such attacks from spreading.
