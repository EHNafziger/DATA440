## Twitter Improves Influenza Forecasting

Influenza is a seasonal viral illness that is not only a major public health threat but also has immense economic implications in lost productivity and work hours for society and the individual. As a result, billions of dollars in research and prevention measures are poured into this area of study every year. One method used to predict the spread of influenza during an epidemic is flu forecasting. With the advent of massive data sets, the Internet, and social media, epidemiological data can be pooled in a database directly after being gathered at hospitals, or it can be derived from data on the Internet. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a database of current and past influenza-like illnesses (ILINet); however, ILINet can be slow to update and can be inaccurate since the initially reported data can be inaccurate and it takes a week for the CDC to publish the “gold standard” cleaned up data, leading to lag times. Google Flu Trends (GFT) is another online tool which uses algorithms to process search results to estimate the current prevalence of influenza in a region, though this method has its own issues with accuracy. Twitter, on the other hand, provides open-source, real-time data in the form of tweets which are accessible by developer tools and web scrapping. For this specific project, an algorithm was used to select tweets about illness, then tweets about influenza, and finally tweets about influenza cases (as opposed to public health advisories). Researchers Paul, Dredze, and Broniatowski developed a linear autoregression model for incorporating Web-based data into their influenza prediction model. 

The researchers developed three models. The goal of each was to use current data (Twitter, GFT) to estimate the revised ILINet gold standard (which while very accurate is late by 1-2 weeks). The first model uses constants from least-square regression multiplied by the unrevised ILINet data, summed over three weeks. The second model added to the previous linear regression a variable equal to the Web-based data for the current time multiplied by a constant. A variation on this model was simply the Web-based data, which was used in the project. Finally, a baseline value for comparison was made for each week by an average of historical data from 19997-2010. Models were trained on ILINet gold standard data from 2011-2013 and produced interesting results. Twitter improved forecasting in all cases and was better at forecasting than the model that relied solely on historical ILINet data. GFT data would actually reduce forecasting accuracy. Twitter data also was able to provide an additional two weeks of accuracy for flu forecasting and remained fairly accurate when comparing the Twitter/unrevised ILINet predictions to the revised ILINet gold standard. Researchers note that GFT data for the selected years performed worse than in other years, which may have had an impact on the results.

This paper is a great example of the fusion of epidemiology and Big Data and machine learning. We have the capabilities to increase our public health predictions and in the process save at the very least thousands of dollars by preemptive public health safety campaigns in targeted areas and hospital ward prep. This strategy could be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach could give hospitals and health departments a warning of when to prepare for a surge in cases and how to mitigate cases to contain cases and reduce deaths.
